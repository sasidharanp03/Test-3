                                 Boundary Value Analysis:

Boundary value analysis is a software testing technique that focuses on testing the limits of input ranges, such as the minimum and maximum values

Working:
Identify boundaries: For a given input range (e.g., age from 20 to 80), the minimum is 22 and the maximum is 80.

Test values: Create test cases using values around the boundaries:
* Minimum boundary: Test the minimum value ,one value below  and one value above  (e.g., 19, 20, 21).
* Maximum boundary: Test the maximum value , one value below  and one value above (e.g., 79, 80, 81).
* Test valid and invalid inputs: 
->valid boundary conditions (like 20 and 80) 
->invalid boundary conditions (like 19 and 81) correctly.

Example:
For an application that requires a password between 30 and 65 characters:
-> Valid values: Test with 30, 31, 64, and 65 characters.
-> Invalid values: Test with 29 characters and 66 characters to ensure the system rejects them

BVA scenario:
-> Minimum value.
-> Just above the minimum.
-> Nominal Value.
-> Just below Max value.
-> Max value.

                                     Equivalence Paritioning:

->Identify the different sets of input.
-> In equivalent data to assign the value are valid or invalid test case.

Valid: 1-50

Invalid: 0 or less

Invalid: Greater than 50

Test Case:

A common example is testing a form that requires a user's age to be between 10 and 70.

Valid partition: Ages 10-70. A test case could be a user aged 45.

Invalid partition: Ages 0-9. A test case could be a user aged 7.

Invalid partition: Ages 61 and above. A test case could be a user aged 70.
