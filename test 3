                                 Boundary Value Analysis:

Boundary value analysis is a software testing technique that focuses on testing the limits of input ranges, such as the minimum and maximum values

Working:
Identify boundaries: For a given input range (e.g., age from 20 to 80), the minimum is 22 and the maximum is 80.

Test values: Create test cases using values around the boundaries:
* Minimum boundary: Test the minimum value ,one value below  and one value above  (e.g., 19, 20, 21).
* Maximum boundary: Test the maximum value , one value below  and one value above (e.g., 79, 80, 81).
* Test valid and invalid inputs: 
->valid boundary conditions (like 20 and 80) 
->invalid boundary conditions (like 19 and 81) correctly.

Example:
For an application that requires a password between 30 and 65 characters:
-> Valid values: Test with 30, 31, 64, and 65 characters.
-> Invalid values: Test with 29 characters and 66 characters to ensure the system rejects them

BVA scenario:
-> Minimum value.
-> Just above the minimum.
-> Nominal Value.
-> Just below Max value.
-> Max value.

   Boundary value Analysis 31 to 88

Invalid (min-1)           Valid (min,min+1,Nominal value,max-1,max)      invalid (max+1) 

     30                            31,32,60,87,88                                89



                                     Equivalence Paritioning:

->Identify the different sets of input.
-> In equivalent data to assign the value are valid or invalid test case.

Valid: 1-50

Invalid: 0 or less

Invalid: Greater than 50

Test Case:

A common example is testing a form that requires a user's age to be between 10 and 70.

Valid partition: Ages 10-70. A test case could be a user aged 45.

Invalid partition: Ages 0-9. A test case could be a user aged 7.

Invalid partition: Ages 61 and above. A test case could be a user aged 70.


                     Software requirements
                                        
->A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective 
 three types in software requirements
                  -> Functional requirements
* to specify the actions that the software needs to perform.
ex:
User Authentication: system allow users to log in using a username and password.
Search Functionality: users to search for products by name or category
Report Generation: The system should be able to generate sales reports for a specified date range.
                   -> Non-functional requirements
*In Non functional requirements system’s behavior, quality, and constraints.
ex:
Performance:  system should process 1,000 transactions per second.
Usability: software should be easy to use and have a user-friendly interface.
Reliability:system must have 99.9% uptime.
Security: Data must be encrypted during transmission and storage.
                  -> Domain requirements
* Domain requirements are specific to the domain or industry in which the software operates.
Ex:
Healthcare: software must in hospital for handling patient data.
Finance:  system should be standards for financial reporting.
E-commerce:software should support various payment gateways like gpay, netpayment, and credit card


                                        Use case testing 
use case testing are  black-box testing technique that validates a system's functionality by creating test cases based on use cases 
-> then we asssign value are correct if conditions is true if its assigned wrong value if condition are false

Based on use cases: use case diagrams or documents
->outline user goals 
->system responses
->derive test cases.

End-to-end coverage: It tests the entire system transaction by transaction, from start to finish,  component testing.
Verifies functional requirements: the system's functional requirements are software works correctly
Includes positive and negative scenarios: Test cases are developed for both the primary success paths and alternative or error paths - invalid login credentials
Supports various testing levels: it is used for system testing and user acceptance testing (UAT) user acceptance testing.


                                         State transition testing 
->state transition testing are  black-box software testing technique that focuses on their a system as it transitions between different states in response to specific events or input.
Core Concepts:
State: A distinct condition .
For example, in a banking application, states could include "Logged Out," "Logged In," "Funds Available," or "Account Locked."
Event: An input or action to a change from one state to another.
Examples include "entering credentials," "making a deposit," or "exceeding login attempts."
Transition: The movement of the system from one state to another
Action: The system's response or output that occurs during or after a state transition
success message, denying access, or performing a calculation.

 login system in state transition system
States:
Unauthenticated,Authentication Processing, Authenticated, Account Locked. 
Events:
Enter Correct Credentials, Enter Incorrect Credentials, Exceed Login Attempts.
Transitions:
Unauthenticated + Enter the Correct Credentials -> Authentication Processing -> authenticated
Unauthenticated" + enter the Incorrect Credentials ( two times) -> Account Locked
